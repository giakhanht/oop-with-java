We carry the universe within us, a symphony of stardust and stories. Even in the
quiet moments, when the world feels vast and we feel small, remember the
constellations flicker in your eyes too. There's a power in that, a connection to 
everything that ever was and all that will be. Don't be afraid to let your own light shine.
